<h1 align="center">GuildBank.exe</h1>
This application was developed as a little personal project to help keep a log of what's going on with the guild bank I manage in my Classic WoW Guild. By no means the best implemented method for the problem, but a fun solution for some transparency within the guild. A simple drop of the textfile created by the application makes sharing the total gold gained by the guild a breeze, also give the ability to leave notes on each transaction to see where the funds are going. Below are some examples of the arguments the application can take.
